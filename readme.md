# Image Classification Project with CIFAR-10 and MNIST

This repository contains various approaches for processing and classifying the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets. The project implements machine learning and deep learning models, including CNN, RNN, LOGREG, and MLP, using both PyTorch and TensorFlow.

## Repository Structure

## Datasets

- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset with 60,000 color images across 10 different classes.
- **MNIST**: A dataset with 70,000 images of handwritten digits.

## Implemented Models

- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)**: Used for feature extraction in images.
- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)**: Models for sequential data, adapted for image classification.
- **LOGREG (Logistic Regression)**: A basic model for comparison.
- **MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)**: A classic approach for classification.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Makonmm/tensorflow-torch-projects.git
   cd CIFAR10-Projects
   cd MNIST-Projects
